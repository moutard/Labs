== SimpleViewer ==

I often used libqglviewer. (http://www.libqglviewer.com/).

SimpleViewer is one of the example provided by libQGLViewer. By default it can
be compiled using qmake.
But as I prefer to use cmake to compile my personnal projects, I create a
specific cmake file, for compiling this example.
