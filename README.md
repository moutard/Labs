I used this repo to save drafts, personnal experiments, or pieces of code I
would like to keep.
As this repo is a sandbox for testing new technologies, new libraries so consider that:

- The code may be not finished
- The code may be not stable
- The code may not compile (or even works sometimes)
- The code quality may be poor

Not sure it can be usefull for anyone, as I do not maintain some of the projects.

Each projects is in a specific folder. If one of the project becomes big enough,
I often create a specific repo for this project. So if you use one of this line
of code it can disappear.
